# Book Of Knowledge ðŸ‘“

## Why?

My memory is garbage. Even though I can remember that the movie of Cloud Atlas has 79 nominations, 15 awards but it wasn't even mentioned in the Oscars of 2013 (which should be a crime btw), I always forget the important things. So this is a small refresher of the things I have learned especially for Development Standards.

Some of the posts in here might contain some code-examples, but it will not contain actual code being used in production (although I will build something for this in the future, it will not be here)

## Posts

- [Development Principles](./docs/principles/index.md)
- [Frameworks](./docs/frameworks/index.md)

## Caveats

- None of the files found in here are actual summaries, nor they should be interpreted as such. They should be interpreted as a couple of notes meant to refresh the memory of the reader.
- Each post contains its own set of links to read through some summaries or even the original content, but the main objective of these posts is to remember a couple of things just by taking a glimpse into them.
- It is your own responsibility to learn through the provided links/videos.
